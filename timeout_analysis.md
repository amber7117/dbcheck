# Timeout Error Analysis and Solution

## Problem Identified

The timeout error occurs in `crawler/search.js` at line 166 where it waits for the selector `#dataTable tbody tr, .no-results` for 80 seconds but times out.

## Root Causes

1. **Authentication Issue**: The cookies in the database show they were last updated on October 2nd, which may have expired
2. **Website Changes**: The target website `zowner.info` may have changed its structure or authentication requirements
3. **Network/Server Issues**: The website might be temporarily unavailable or slow to respond
4. **Selector Issues**: The selectors `#dataTable tbody tr` or `.no-results` might not exist on the page

## Solutions

### Immediate Fixes:

1. **Update Authentication**: Force a re-login to refresh cookies
2. **Reduce Timeout**: Lower the timeout from 80 seconds to a more reasonable value
3. **Better Error Handling**: Add more specific error handling for different failure scenarios
4. **Alternative Selectors**: Add fallback selectors in case the primary ones don't work

### Code Changes Needed:

1. **In `crawler/search.js`**:
   - Add more robust selector waiting with multiple fallbacks
   - Reduce timeout to 30-45 seconds
   - Add better error messages for different failure types
   - Implement page content inspection for debugging

2. **In `crawler/login.js`**:
   - Add better validation of login success
   - Implement cookie expiration checking

### Testing Steps:

1. Test login functionality first
2. Test search with a known working query
3. Verify page structure and selectors
4. Monitor network requests and responses

## Recommended Implementation

The main issue appears to be authentication-related. The cookies are likely expired, and the system is waiting for a response that never comes because the user is not properly authenticated.
